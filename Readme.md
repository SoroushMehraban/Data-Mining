# Data Mining assignments
## Fall 2021 semester
This repository contains data mining assignments that were given in the fall 2021 semester.

For each assignment, a report outlining algorithms and code is supplied (In Farsi).

Algorithms implemented in each assignment are:
- **Assignment 1**: 
  - Linear regression using gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent (from scratch).
  - Data preprocessing using pandas 
- **Assignment 2**:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Decision tree using gini and entropy as criterion (from scratch)
  - K-nearest neighbor (from scratch)
  - Naive bayes (from scratch)
- **Assignment 3**:
  - Linear SVM (from scratch)
  - Non-linear SVM
  - Random Forest (from scratch)
  - Adaboost  
- **Assignment 4**:
  - K-Means clustering (from scratch)
  - PCA (from scratch)
